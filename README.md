# Greek Namedays
A list of all Greek Namedays as JSON and tips on how to handle Greek Namedays

This repository contains a collection of all Greek Namedays. This list was created by scrapping information from various websites online so the list might contain errors or missing information. PRs are more than welcome in order to have an up-to-date source of all Greek Namedays ðŸ˜„

### Why?
I noticed there are no sources available online for that. Since Namedays are a big thing in Greece, and collecting them all is a huge effort, I decided to share what I have gathered so that more can benefit.

## How does it work?
There are currently two JSON files with all Namedays in place.

### Recurring Namedays [(recurring_namedays.json)](https://github.com/alexstyl/Greek-namedays/blob/master/recurring_namedays.json)
In this file you can find all namedays with fixed date.

### Easter Related Namedays [(relative_to_easter.json)](https://github.com/alexstyl/Greek-namedays/blob/master/relative_to_easter.json)
This file contains all namedays assosiated to easter. You need to calculate Easter Sunday first before finding the exact nameday of a specific year for those.

### Calculating Easter
Greeks celebrate the Orthodox Easter. You can find [a Java implementation](https://github.com/alexstyl/Greek-namedays/blob/master/OrthodoxEasterCalculator.java) of how to calculate the Easter Sunday, but you can find a lot of ways of calculating by yourself online ([such as on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computus#Gauss_algorithm)).
